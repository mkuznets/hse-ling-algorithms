# Curriculum

* **Data and Computing**: computation model; integers; floating-point; bitwise operations; programming languages; arrays; pointers.
* **Algorithm Analysis:** running time: worst-, average-, and expected cases; asymptotic notation and analysis; amortised analysis.
* **Data Structures:** dynamic array; multidimensional arrays; linked lists; stacks; queues; priority queues and heaps.
* **Sorting (and The Importance of Being Sorted):** binary search; merging sorted sequences; comparison sorts: selection sort, heapsort, mergesort, quicksort; non-comparison sorts: counting sort, radix sort.
* **Trees:** definitions and properties; binary trees; binary search trees: walks, search, min, max, successor, predecessor, insert, delete.
* **Hashing:** hash functions; hash tables; collision resolution: chaining, open addressing.
* **Dictionaries and Sets:** lookup tables; bit arrays; limitations of hash tables; balanced search trees; skip lists; bloom filters.
* **Dynamic Programming:** 'optimised recursion': top-down and bottom-up; text segmentation; edit distance; longest increasing subsequence.
* **Graphs:** definitions; data structures: adjacency matrix, adjacency lists; depth- and breadth-first search; topological sort; disjoint-set (union-find); minimum spanning tree: Kruskal, Prim; shortest path problem: Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra.
* **Strings:** edit-friendly string: gap buffers, ropes; edit distance on multiple documents; string matching: Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Boyer-Moore; prefix trees (tries); suffix trees.
